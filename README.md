# Covert-Ops
 I am a member of an elite Tech Ops team and will be assisting super spy Agent Storm as he attempts to rescue a group of captives from an enemy stronghold.  To gain entry, Agent Storm will need to bypass several electronic locks.  Fortunately, we have the compiled program that controls these locks. All we need to do is reverse engineer the executable and give the codes to our hero.
